# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **KnowledgeWiki** - a personal knowledge management system built with Docusaurus 3.8.1. It serves as a terminal-first note-taking system where content is stored as Markdown files in the `docs/` directory and automatically deployed as a public website via GitHub Pages.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (opens browser at localhost:3000)
npm start

# Build production site
npm run build

# Serve built site locally
npm run serve

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy

# Clear cache
npm run clear

# Generate translation files
npm write-translations

# Add heading IDs to markdown
npm run write-heading-ids
```

## Architecture & Structure

### Core Architecture
- **Docusaurus 3.8.1** with React 19.0.0 
- **Auto-generated sidebar** from `docs/` folder structure via `tutorialSidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}]`
- **Preset Classic** configuration with docs, blog, and theme components
- **Node.js 18+** requirement

### Key Directories
- `docs/` - All Markdown notes and documentation content
- `blog/` - Blog posts (optional)
- `src/pages/` - Custom React pages
- `src/components/` - Custom React components
- `static/` - Static assets (images, files)
- `docusaurus.config.js` - Main configuration
- `sidebars.js` - Sidebar configuration (currently auto-generated)

### Content Management
- Notes are Markdown files in `docs/` folder
- Sidebar navigation auto-generated from folder structure  
- Support for MDX (Markdown + JSX) via @mdx-js/react
- Category files use `_category_.json` for folder organization

## Development Workflow

### Adding Content
1. Create/edit Markdown files in `docs/` directory
2. Folder structure automatically becomes sidebar navigation
3. Use `_category_.json` files to customize folder display names and ordering

### Testing Changes
1. Use `npm start` for live development with hot reload
2. Use `npm run build` to test production build
3. Use `npm run serve` to preview built site locally

### Customization
- React components in `src/components/`
- Custom CSS in `src/css/custom.css`
- Homepage customization in `src/pages/index.js`
- Theme configuration in `docusaurus.config.js`

## Important Notes

- The project uses npm (not yarn) based on package.json scripts
- Auto-deployment to GitHub Pages happens on commits (mentioned in README)
- Configuration still has default Docusaurus placeholder values that may need customization
- Sidebar generation is fully automated - manual sidebar config is commented out in `sidebars.js`
