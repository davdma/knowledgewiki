# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **KnowledgeWiki** - a personal knowledge management system built with Docusaurus 3.8.1. It serves as a terminal-first note-taking system where content is stored as Markdown files in the `docs/` directory and automatically deployed as a public website via GitHub Pages.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (opens browser at localhost:3000)
npm start

# Build production site
npm run build

# Serve built site locally
npm run serve

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy

# Clear cache
npm run clear

# Generate translation files
npm write-translations

# Add heading IDs to markdown
npm run write-heading-ids
```

## Architecture & Structure

### Core Architecture
- **Docusaurus 3.8.1** with React 19.0.0 
- **Auto-generated sidebar** from `docs/` folder structure via `tutorialSidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}]`
- **Preset Classic** configuration with docs, blog, and theme components
- **Node.js 18+** requirement

### Key Directories
- `docs/` - All Markdown notes and documentation content
- `blog/` - Blog posts (optional)
- `src/pages/` - Custom React pages
- `src/components/` - Custom React components
- `static/` - Static assets (images, files)
- `docusaurus.config.js` - Main configuration
- `sidebars.js` - Sidebar configuration (currently auto-generated)

### Content Management
- Notes are Markdown files in `docs/` folder
- Sidebar navigation auto-generated from folder structure  
- Support for MDX (Markdown + JSX) via @mdx-js/react
- Category files use `_category_.json` for folder organization

## Development Workflow

### Adding Content
1. Create/edit Markdown files in `docs/` directory
2. Folder structure automatically becomes sidebar navigation
3. Use `_category_.json` files to customize folder display names and ordering

### Testing Changes
1. Use `npm start` for live development with hot reload
2. Use `npm run build` to test production build
3. Use `npm run serve` to preview built site locally

### Customization
- React components in `src/components/`
- Custom CSS in `src/css/custom.css`
- Homepage customization in `src/pages/index.js`
- Theme configuration in `docusaurus.config.js`

## Note-Taking Guidelines

### Purpose & Workflow
This KnowledgeWiki serves as a centralized learning repository where each folder represents a topic with markdown files as individual sections. Follow this AI-powered learning workflow:

1. **Initial Learning**: Jot down raw notes, then use Claude to clarify, generate examples, and add summaries
2. **Structure**: Keep concise overview at top of file, with detailed notes below  
3. **Retention**: Generate Q&A from notes for active recall (multiple choice, open-ended, true/false, "explain like I'm 5")
4. **Review**: After quizzes, identify shaky topics and get suggestions for next learning steps

### Content Style & Formatting

#### Admonitions
Use these specific admonition types with consistent conventions:

```md
:::info[Key Idea]
Use this to mark key insights and ideas that are important to revisit.
:::

:::tip[Trick]
Use this to highlight study strategies, memory aids, or shortcuts to help learn a difficult topic.
:::

:::note[Detail]
Use this to mention a useful detail that does not fit into the main text. Can bring up general context or background knowledge that helps with understanding a new concept.
:::

:::warning[Pitfall]
Use this to bring attention to common misunderstandings or pitfalls, e.g. `==` is very different from `===` in javascript (loose vs. strict equality).
:::

:::danger[Do Not Forget]
Use this to highlight a critical piece of information you must NOT forget, otherwise it will cause you a lot of headache.
:::
```

#### Text Highlighting (MDX Components)
For `.mdx` files, add these imports at the top of the file:

import { BlueHighlight, GreenHighlight } from '@site/src/components/Highlight';

Then use:
- `<BlueHighlight>key term</BlueHighlight>` for key terms
- `<GreenHighlight>important details</GreenHighlight>` for details that aid understanding

#### Interactive Elements

**Collapsible Sections:**
```html
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Hidden content with **Markdown formatting**, lists, code blocks, images, etc.

- Bullet points
- More text

```python
print("Hello, collapsible!")
```
</details>
```

**Quizzes (MDX):**
Add this import at the top: `import Quiz from '@site/src/components/Quiz';`

Then use the Quiz component with question arrays:

<Quiz
  questions={[
    {
      question: "What is dynamic programming?",
      options: [
        "Solving problems recursively without memoization",
        "Breaking a problem into overlapping subproblems", 
        "Sorting arrays in-place",
        "Using brute force for all solutions"
      ],
      answer: 1
    }
  ]}
/>

#### Code Blocks
**With Titles and Highlighting:**
```jsx title="/src/components/HighlightCode.js"
function HighlightSomeText(highlight) {
  if (highlight) {
    // highlight-next-line
    return 'This text is highlighted!';
  }

  return 'Nothing highlighted';
}

function HighlightMoreText(highlight) {
  // highlight-start
  if (highlight) {
    return 'This range is highlighted!';
  }
  // highlight-end

  return 'Nothing highlighted';
}
```

**With Line Numbers:**
```jsx showLineNumbers
import React from 'react';

export default function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div>Foo</div>;
}
```

#### Math Equations
Use KaTeX for mathematical content:
- Inline: `$f\colon[a,b]\to\R$`
- Block: `$$I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x)\,dx$$`

#### Images
Add images to `static/img/` folder and reference with absolute paths:
```md
![Docusaurus logo](/img/docusaurus.png)
```

### File Organization
- Use [number prefixes](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#using-number-prefixes) for both folders and files to control sidebar ordering
- Example: `01-Intro/`, `02-Advanced/`, `01-intro.md`, `02-interactivity.md`

### AI Assistant Instructions
When helping with note-taking:
1. Suggest appropriate admonitions based on content type
2. Generate concise overviews for the top of files
3. Create quiz questions using the Quiz component when requested
4. Use highlighting components for key terms and important details
5. Structure content with collapsible sections for detailed explanations
6. Follow the number prefix convention for new files/folders

## Important Notes

- The project uses npm (not yarn) based on package.json scripts
- Auto-deployment to GitHub Pages happens on commits (mentioned in README)
- Configuration still has default Docusaurus placeholder values that may need customization
- Sidebar generation is fully automated - manual sidebar config is commented out in `sidebars.js`
