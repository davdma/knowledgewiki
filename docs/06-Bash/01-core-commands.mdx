# Core Commands

Here I list core commands (e.g. `ps`, `du`, `find`) grouped by functionality for proficient use of the shell.

## Navigation and Filesystem

### `pwd` Print Working Dir

`pwd` prints the absolute filepath of the current working directory.

```bash
pwd
```

Will print out something like:

```bash
/home/users/Documents
```

### `du` Disk Usage

One mistake I used to make is use `ls -lah` to see directory sizes, which always surprisingly small, until I realized it only displayed the size of the directory entry, not its contents. To see actual disk usage of an entire directory, use `du -sh` where `-s` summarizes and `-h` makes the size human readable.

```bash
# Show size of each subdirectory in current directory
du -sh *

# Show size of a specific directory (and its subdirectories)
du -sh path/to/dir

# Show a sorted list of the biggest directories/files
du -sh * | sort -h
```

### `df` Disk Free

The `df` command stands for "disk free" and reports the amount of available and consumed disk space on filesystems.
