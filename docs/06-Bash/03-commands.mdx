# Bash Commands

## Disk Usage

One mistake I used to make is use `ls -lah` to see directory sizes, which always surprisingly small, until I realized it only displayed the size of the directory entry, not its contents. To see actual disk usage of an entire directory, use `du -sh` where `-s` summarizes and `-h` makes the size human readable.

```bash
# Show size of each subdirectory in current directory
du -sh *

# Show size of a specific directory (and its subdirectories)
du -sh path/to/dir

# Show a sorted list of the biggest directories/files
du -sh * | sort -h
```
