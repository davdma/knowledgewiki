# Random Facts

I put random facts I find interesting in here, or something I want to remember.

## Latency and A/B Testing

A famous Amazon A/B test intentionally delayed page latency by **100ms** and found even small delays (not noticeable by blink of an eye) can have substantial impact on user engagement and revenue outcomes. This is also an example of high <BlueHighlight>elasticity</BlueHighlight>, where demand is very sensitive to small factors. If a site slows just slightly, there's a big shift in the user response and behavior. Thus, <GreenHighlight>there is a high elasticity of demand with respect to latency</GreenHighlight>.

### Elasticity
Elasticity can be thought of as synonymous with sensitivity.
Other economic examples of elasticity include **price elasticity** where raising the price of a product like coffee by 10 cents can have dramatic reduction in the number of sales.

The mathematical formulation of elasticity is:

$$
\text{Price elasticity} = \frac{\%\Delta \text{Quantity Demanded}}{\%\Delta \text{Price}}
$$

For elasticity $>1$ it is elastic (sensitive), elasticity $<1$ it is inelastic (insensitive) and $=1$ it is unit elastic (proportional).
