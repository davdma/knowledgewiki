# React

## What is React for?

React is used for building UI with <BlueHighlight>components</BlueHighlight>. A component is **a piece of reusable code** that represents a part of the UI, with their own logic and appearance, and can range from buttons to whole pages. As such, React apps are made up of lots of components.

For example, a component might be:

```js
function MyButton() {
    return (
        <button>I'm a button</button>
    )
}
```

Then you can nest it into another component:

```js
export default function MyApp() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
            <MyButton />
        </div>
    )
}
```

:::note[Detail]

The `export default` specifies the main component in the file.

:::

A react component can be identified by names that start with capital letters, such as `<MyButton />`.

Most React projects use `jsx` which allows for HTML-like code inside javascript.

## Hooks

<BlueHighlight>React hooks</BlueHighlight> lets you "hook into" React's state and lifecycle features. The reason why this is necessary is because originally with functional components e.g. `function Component() {}` they were stateless, and couldn't remember values across renders. This was as opposed to class components where you could do `this.state`, but it caused lots of boiler plate code with constructors etc. With React hooks you could use functional components and keep track of state throughout.

## `useState`

`useState` is a **React hook**. You use it at the top of the component to declare a state variable. It specifically returns an array with two variables, one is the state variable, the other is a setter function.

:::note[Detail]

Since `useState` is a hook, you can only call it at the top level of your component, not inside loops or components.

:::

Commonly you will see:

```js
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
```

The value of `state` gets set initially to `initialState`. Then later the `set` function lets you update the variable and trigger a re-render.

## `useEffect`

`useEffect` takes two arguments, a `setup` function and an optional `dependencies` argument. The `dependencies` are reactive arguments, and React will compare the dependencies with their previous values - if the dependencies change, React will re-render and run the `setup` functions with the new values.

## `useRef`

`useRef` is a React hook to reference a value that's not needed for rendering. It's a mutable object that React keeps the same across renders. You call it at the top level of component to declare a ref. `useRef` returns an object with a singular property `current` set to `initialValue` which is mutable. On next renders `useRef` returns the same object.

```js
// { current: ... }
const ref = useRef(initialValue);
console.log(ref.current); // access the value
ref.current = newValue; // update the value

```

As opposed to `state` from `useState`, updating the `current` property does not trigger a re-render.

When to use refs:
1. Accessing DOM elements
2. Store values that do not trigger re-render
3. Keep previous values
4. Avoid object recreation

### Accessing DOM Elements

For example:
```jsx
function Example() {
  const divRef = useRef(null);

  return <div ref={divRef}>Hello</div>;
}
```

Here `divRef` starts as `{ current: null }` but when rendered React creates the `<div>` and sees the `ref={divRef}` argument, and assigns the DOM element to the `.current` property. As a result you can call DOM methods on the `ref`: `divRef.current.focus()`.

<details>
<summary>DOM Elements</summary>

The <BlueHighlight>DOM</BlueHighlight> (Document Object Model) is a **tree-like representation** of the webpage that is built from HTML. Every element in the DOM becomes a javascript object inside the tree, which expose properties like `id`, `className`, `innerText` and methods like `.focus()`, `.click()` and `.appendChild()`. 

</details>

### Referencing a Value

Example:

```jsx

import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const ref = useRef(0);

  function handleClick() {
    ref.current = ref.current + 1;
    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me!
    </button>
  );
}

```

On each re-render `useRef(0)` returns the same ref object as guaranteed by React.

### `useState` vs `useRef`

:::info[Key Idea]

`useState` is good for when the value should cause a re-render if it changes, `useRef` is good when the value should persist across renders but not directly cause a re-render.

:::

## `JSON.stringify`

Built in javascript method to convert object or array into a JSON string (aka serialization). This is commonly used to prepare javascript data to be sent to a server.

## Passing Props

React components communicate with each other using <BlueHighlight>props</BlueHighlight> (this is shorthand for **properties**). Every parent component can pass info to child components with props. In React, props can be thought at a high level as <GreenHighlight>inputs to a component</GreenHighlight>.

Props are simply info you pass to a JSX tag. For instance with `<img className="avatar" src="..." alt="Lin Lanying" />`, you are passing props `className`, `src`, `alt` to `<img>`.

Let's pass props from parent to child component:

```jsx

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      person={{ name: 'Lin Lanying', imageId: '1bX5QH6' }}
      size={100}
    />
  );
}

function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // child component reads props
  // person and size are available here
}

```

:::info[Key Idea]

In React **props are the only argument to your component**. What's really happening is this, which is valid code:

```jsx

function Avatar(props) {
  let person = props.person;
  let size = props.size;
  // ...
}

```

But many cases you don't need the whole `props` argument, so you destructure it into `Avatar({ person, size })`.

:::

## Synthetic Event Handlers

Instead of `addEventListener` in components (see [here](../05-Languages/03-Javascript.mdx#addeventlistener)), React provides <BlueHighlight>synthetic event handlers</BlueHighlight> like such:

```jsx

export default function Button() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert('You clicked me!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}


```

The `handleClick` function is an event handler that is **passed as a prop** to `<button>`. Event handler props generally start with `on` followed by capital letter.
