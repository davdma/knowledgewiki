# Plugins

With `kickstart.nvim` plugins, there will be access to useful commands starting with `<leader>` prefix. In my config, I have this leader key set to spacebar.

## Browsing the Filesystem

Often times in my workflow I find myself in need of opening another file while editing the current one. Instead of `:wq` to exit out of the current file, `cd`-ing to the right directory and then opening the target file in neovim, I found it was much easier to have split screens so you can keep the original file open while navigating to the target file in another window.

If the file is on the same directory level as the current file, default vim has `:edit file.txt` command for switching over. However, if the file requires further navigation, this won't be as useful. The most convenient way if you have recently opened the file you want to navigate to is to use `<leader>s.` - this will open up a list of your recent files, and pressing `Enter` will switch to that file. However, if you have not opened the file before, you will need to use a different plugin.

My neovim setup comes installed with `neo-tree` which is a plugin to browse the file system while in neovim. This can be done by typing `:Neotree`. This by default opens a file system window on the left that displays your files <GreenHighlight>starting from the current working directory</GreenHighlight>. To open the bar while keeping focus on your current window use `:Neotree show`. If you want to navigate up a directory, you will have to provide a `dir` argument to neo-tree by simply passing in a directory path, so `:Neotree ../` will start a directory up from the current file. You can always change the cwd of the neotree window later by typing in `:Neotree somedir/` (note that relative filepaths will use your current cwd). If you want to look at your open buffers, you can also do `:Neotree buffers`. To close the neotree window, type `:Neotree close`.

## Powerful LSPs

With LSPs you have language specific tools such as `grd` to jump to definition of the function, and `grr` to go to reference (if there exists multiple it will provide a list for you to choose). You can also use `K` to see documentation pop up for a function.
