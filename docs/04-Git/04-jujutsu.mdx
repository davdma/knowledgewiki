# Jujutsu

The jujutsu version control system is an attempt to improve upon `git` while staying `git` compatible. This means that you can use jujutsu quite easily with current `git` repositories and always go back to using `git` if you want.

The big thing about Jujutsu is that it offers features that `git` does not have. A working copy as a commit model means that you no longer need to think about index area and staging. The logging is also more extensive so undoing operations are much easier than `git` which requires a lot more thought and care. The automatic rebasing also makes rebasing seamless instead of having to do `git rebase --update-refs` and setting `rerere`.
