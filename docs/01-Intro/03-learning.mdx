# Learning Techniques

This page reviews a variety of learning techniques and their efficacy as described in education research. The goal is to aid in structuring the notes to focus on long term learning and retention.

## Distributed Practice

Distributed practice, also known as spaced repetition, involves study sessions spread out over time as opposed to cramming. Research finds that learning opportunities are more effective when spaced out than in mass. It shows the highest efficacy in long term retention.

To apply distributed practice, <GreenHighlight>implement a schedule of study and practice spread out over a period of time</GreenHighlight>. Make sure to review previously covered material in subsequent units of work, have practice / tests at spaced intervals rather at the very end.

## Practice Testing

Practice testing involves self-testing or retrieval practice on to-be-learned material, and is separate from high stakes testing. It is the chance for the student to practice retrieval of information and evaluate it against a 'correct' answer. This can range from completing example questions in textbooks, to previous exams, to self generated flash cards.

:::info[Key Idea]

Practice testing works very well when paired with **feedback** and **when spaced out**. Try to apply practice testing over unguided restudy of material when possible.

Use **flashcards, quizzes, practices questions** often over just re-reading content.

:::tip[Trick]

For memorizing vocabulary and specific facts, flashcard apps like **Anki** designed around spaced repetition and active recall can be useful.

## Building Projects

Since most literature measure impact on surface / factual level learning, some of these techniques may be less relevant when it comes to deep understanding and learning complex tasks. For improving deep understanding and problem solving ability, experts like Andrej Karpathy have pointed towards building projects, or 'reinventing the wheel' as a key step to reaching deep understanding on subjects.
