# Jupyter Notebook

Some handy jupyter lab shortcuts for better notebook work in ML from this tutorial [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/most-useful-keyboard-shortcuts-for-notebook-lab/18113).

## Command & Edit Modes

There are **two distinct modes** in jupyter notebooks. Different shortcuts apply based on which mode you are in (think vim modes). When your cursor is active inside a cell, you are in <BlueHighlight>edit mode</BlueHighlight>. You can also enter **edit mode** with `ENTER` or clicking on the cell editor area. If you escape with `ESC` then you are in <BlueHighlight>command mode</BlueHighlight>.

:::info[Key Idea]

**Command mode** gives you control over the notebook as a whole, while **edit mode** is specific to the cell that you are editing.

Use **command mode** for notebook and cell actions and **edit mode** to type in individual cells.

## Running Cells

To run cell in either mode:
- `CTRL+ENTER` runs cell
- `SHIFT+ENTER` runs and moves to cell below

## Command Mode Shortcuts

The basic overview:
1. Navigation: `ENTER`, `up/k`, `down/j`
2. Saving: `s`
3. Change cell types: `y`, `m`
4. Cell creation: `a`, `b`
5. Cell editing: `x`, `c`, `v`, `z`

**Useful shortcuts I would use often**:
- Go up and down cells with `j` and `k` like vim
- <GreenHighlight>Create cells</GreenHighlight> **above** current cell with `a` and **below** current cell with `b`
- <GreenHighlight>Change the cell type</GreenHighlight> to **markdown** with `m` or **code** with `y`

Cell level operations:
- Cut cells with `x` (good for delete as well)
- Copy cells with `c`
- Paste cells with `v`
- Undo cell operation with `z`

You can also merge cells:
- Select multiple cells with `SHIFT+up` and `SHIFT+down`
- Merge cells with `SHIFT+m`
- On single cell `CTRL+SHIFT+m` to merge with the one below

:::note[Detail]

You can string these shortcuts together. An example is selecting multiple cells with `SHIFT+up` or `SHIFT+down` and converting all of them to markdown with `m`.

:::

Sometimes output of cells can long and clutter the screen:
- Collapse and uncollapse output of a cell using `o`

## Edit Mode Shortcuts

Ones I commonly use:
- Toggle between comment and uncommented code with `Ctrl+/`.
- Split cells with `CTRL+SHIFT+-` at the cursor inside a cell.
